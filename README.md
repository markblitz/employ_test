# employ_test

This is the test assignment for FlyHigh. This project is a mimic of a job seeking system. My realization starts from adding seekers' information into the database. Backend part uses sqlite3, flask for Python and should be viewed by JupyterLab. Frontend part... has not been fully realized.

## Updates on 2021-11-4

Core function of backend, aka the database is finished. 

**job_seeker.ipynb** defines a class Job_Seeker_System. This class has one function which adds information of one user into the database. 

**DVsetting.ipynb** is the setting file used to initialize the database. 

**test.db** is the database is SQLite.

Folder **websites** and **job_seeker_system** are html files and vue project which has not been fully learned and understood.
